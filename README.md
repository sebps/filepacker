# Filepacker
Package providing a way to pack a full directory of files into a single go file in order to provide access to their content at runtime.

## Install 
go install github.com/sebps/filepacker@v1.0.0

## Pack files
To pack a given directory into a single file package go file, run the following command :

`filepacker pack -s directory -t package -p resources` 

This will generate a filepackage.go file recursively wrapping all of the current directory files. Any file will futher be accessible combining a leading character "/" and the path of the file relatively to its source directory.

## Usage 

## Generated file 

The result of the previous command execution will be a **package.go** file with the following content :

```go
package resources // package name using flag -p

// Code generated by filepacker; DO NOT EDIT.

var repositoryInstance *repository

func init() {
	repositoryInstance = &repository{
		storage: make(map[string][]byte),
	}
	repositoryInstance.storage["/test.txt"] = []byte{116, 101, 115, 116}
}

type repository struct {
	storage map[string][]byte
}

func (r *repository) Get(filename string) []byte {
	return repositoryInstance.storage[filename]
}
```


## Access files
At runtime, content of the files can be accessed from anywhere using the package getter as follows : 

```
import (
    filepackage "module_name/resources"
) 

var fileBytes []byte := filepackage.Get('/<file_path>')
```
